## Valid Labels

- `praise` - Praises highlight something positive

- `suggestion` - Suggestions propose improvements
- `issue` - Issues highlight specific problems
- `todo` - TODO's are small, trivial, but necessary changes
- `question` - Questions for clarification or investigation
- `thought` - Thoughts represent ideas that popped up from reviewing
- `chore` - Chores are simple tasks that must be done
- `note` - Notes highlight something the reader should take note of
- `typo` - Typo comments for misspellings
- `polish` - Polish comments for quality improvements
- `quibble` - Quibbles are very much like nitpicks

## Valid Decorations

- `non-blocking` - Should not prevent acceptance
- `blocking` - Should prevent acceptance until resolved
- `if-minor` - Should resolve only if changes are minor
- `security` - Security-related comment
- `test` - Test-related comment
- `ux` - User experience related
- `performance` - Performance related
- `accessibility` - Accessibility related
- `documentation` - Documentation related
- `style` - Code style related

## Auto-Coloring

The badges automatically use appropriate colors based on:
- **Label colors**: Based on the comment type
- **Message colors**: Based on the first decoration (or label color if no decorations)

## Clipboard Integration

Both scripts automatically copy the generated markdown to your clipboard:
- **macOS**: Uses `pbcopy`
- **Linux**: Uses `xclip` or `xsel`
- **Fallback**: Shows manual copy instructions if clipboard tools aren't available

The markdown is ready to paste immediately into:
- GitHub README files
- Documentation
- Code review comments
- Project wikis
- Any markdown editor

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Not Found
- Ensure Node.js is installed and in your PATH
- The scripts require Node.js 18.0.0 or higher

### Build Errors
- The scripts will automatically attempt to build the project
- If build fails, manually run `npm run build` in the project root

### Invalid Arguments
- Check the valid labels and decorations lists above
- Use the quick badge generator for common combinations

## Integration

These badges can be used in:
- GitHub README files
- Documentation
- Code review comments
- Project wikis
- Any markdown or HTML content

The generated URLs point to Shields.io static badge images that will automatically update when the badge parameters change.
